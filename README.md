# ⚛️ React, TypeScript, Vite Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate to be used as a starter for using React with TypeScript, Vite, linting and formatting.

## 🎨 Linting and formatting

**ESLint** is used with:
- `typescript-eslint`
- `eslint-plugin-import`
- `eslint-plugin-react`
- `eslint-plugin-prettier`
- `eslint-config-prettier`

As the Prettier *plugin* is used, only ESLint needs to be installed for both linting and formatting.

## 🔧 Development Server

Run `npm run dev` to start the Vite development server.

## Building

For the production builds, **Vite** is also used.

Run `npm run build` to create a build in the `dist` folder.
